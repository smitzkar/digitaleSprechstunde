# digitaleSprechstunde
Attempt at creating an interactive educative page for my work at the library.

## Plan  

### Search Engines (2022 German marketshare in percent)

#### Google 91  
- by far the biggest and for a reason: it works  
- has lots of nice extra features (image search, Google scholar, etc.)
- very annoying ads -> gets worse every year  

#### Bing 6  
- similar layout to Google, don't really gain anything from switching to it  
- not recommended

#### Duckduckgo 1  
- claims to protect privacy  
- ads are really annoying and the custom font and colours are more trouble than they're worth 

#### Ecosia 1
- very few ads, if at all  
- keeps the basic colour scheme  
- fonts can be somewhat messed up on some devices  
- Suchgebiet und Zeit are nice features!  
- plant trees!

---  

So why use anything but Google?  
- ads are annoying  
- other search engines might be more consistent at showing us what we want to see  
- because we can!  

Personal recommendation: ecosia (or just use Google)  

### Bonus Tips  
- INSTALL UBLOCK ORIGIN!!!! (will soon require the use of Firefox, but it's undoubtedly worth it)
