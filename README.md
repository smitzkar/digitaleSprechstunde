# digitaleSprechstunde
Attempt at creating an interactive educative page for my work at the library.

## Plan  
- first create a presentation/seminar for library  
- using the responses there, develop a simple web page for users to check in later or as a standalone  
- if possible, make it an interactive learning environment, with embedded (or fake) google searches  
  - how to spot and avoid ads  
  - how to deal with cookies  
  - make it fun! -> timer with high scores and such, maybe a hardcore mode

### Start with example - in media res  
- look up certain flower?  
- what could be a thing for seniors?  
- maybe a meta joke on how to google "how to use google"?

- ask people what they might want to look up! -> get them invested  

### Browser Basics  
- left / right click  
- hyperlinks -> blue to purple  
- going back a page  
- tabs  

### Search Engines (2022 German marketshare in percent)  
KEEP THIS VERY SHORT!!  
is very boring  

#### Google 91  
- by far the biggest and for a reason: it works  
- has lots of nice extra features (image search, Google scholar, etc.)
- very annoying ads -> gets worse every year  

#### Bing 6  
- similar layout to Google, don't really gain anything from switching to it  
- sometimes better at guessing what one was looking for
- not recommended

#### Duckduckgo 1  
- claims to protect privacy  
- ads are really annoying and the custom font and colours are more trouble than they're worth 
- not recommended

#### Ecosia 1
- very few ads, if at all  
- keeps the basic colour scheme  
- fonts can be somewhat messed up on some devices  
- Suchgebiet und Zeit are nice features!  
- plant trees!

---  

So why use anything but Google?  
- ads are annoying  
- other search engines might be more consistent at showing us what we want to see  
- because we can!  

Personal recommendation: ecosia (or just use Google)  

### Bonus Tips  
- INSTALL UBLOCK ORIGIN!!!! (will soon require the use of Firefox, but it's undoubtedly worth it)
- exact search, exluded words, etc. 
- bookmarks
- little detour: problem solving in the digital age? (that could be the title of the whole thing?)
